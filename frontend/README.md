# OnlyTanks Frontend

## ⚡️ Quick start

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) installed.

Make sure the dependencies are correctly installed

```bash
yarn
```

Then, to run the frontend locally run

```bash
yarn dev
```

Additionally, you can create a production build with

```bash
# Build the app
yarn build

# Run the build
yarn start
```

For docker, refer to the [project's global README](../README.md#-using-docker)

Either way, the app will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.
